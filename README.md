# STOCK ANALYSIS 

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

Steve is helping his parents with investing into stocks. He wants an analysis of green stock to see if it is even worth them investing. I did this while using VBA in Excel to find the stocks volume and annual return. That way i was able to use my findings to give Steve's parents the best investment options. 


### PURPOSE 

Steve wants to go from the dozen stocks we originally analyzed to analyzing an entire stock market for the last few years. In order to look at thousands of stocks we need to refactor our code to make our VBA script run faster, making the analysis more efficient. 

# RESULTS

## 2017 VS 2018
When comparing 2017 vs 2018 we can see that almost all of the stocks declined in volume, while only very few produced a positive ROI. When we refactor the code, it runs faster than the original code which makes it more efficient. I would suggest for Steve to have his parents look at investing in a different industry. 


## Code Refactoring

In order to make the code more effiecient I had to create three new arrays; tickerVolumes(12), tickerStartingPrices(12), and tickerEndingPrices(12). 
These three arrays were matched by using the variable called tickerIndex. These arrays allow me to loop through the data to complete my findings. 

# Summary

Refactoring a code comes with advantages because it can allow it to run more efficiently and faster. When refactoring you can have issues with running the original code properly, which I occured when factoring. 

When refactoring in VBA it is easy to compare the original code with the one that you ae refactoring. You can come across a lot of issues in VBA when refactoring if you don't know how to use syntax properly.
